Project: Migrating On-Prem multi-service Application to AWS

Problem Statement:

Company ABC wants to make a move to AWS. They were looking for a professional cloud consultant who could migrate the companyâ€™s infrastructure to cloud. ABC is a image hosting platform. The user comes to the website, uploads images, and these images are then stored on the server. 

ABC has everything connected to their MySQL Database which exists on the same machine as the other applications.

The other applications include, a backend processing system and a front-end website.

As the first stage of migration, you take help from the development team and do the following changes:

	1. Containerize the backend processing system
	2. The website now uploads data to AWS S3
	3. Export the whole system into a VM OVA file

For the second stage, you plan the following:

	1. Migrate this VM to AWS EC2 to get a public IP address
	2. Upload the front end to Elastic Beanstalk
	3. Migrate MySQL DB to Amazon Aurora
	4. Upload the backend system to AWS ECR and ECS
	5. Transfer the existing data to the target AWS S3 bucket using Transfer Acceleration
