Project: AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Training

You are now a part of the DevOps team in Logicworks company, which is a leading AWS consulting and Managed Services Provider with 25 years of experience in enterprise IT. Your first project is to replicate the current environment on AWS as per the following requirements:

1. Adoption of IAC (Infrastructure as Code) to facilitate faster replication of environments for different customers who may have a need for similar environments.

2. Infrastructure must include multi-region architecture and needs to run in two different regions
for High Availability and Disaster Recovery purposes. (Hint: ensure proper networking system)

3. The applications should be run in a container to prevent errors and inconsistencies. The container images are supposed to be stored in a docker image repository. Additionally, a container
management system has to be implemented to manage growth in the number of containers in
the future.

4. Manual CI/CD pipeline deployments did not fulfill the requirements. Hence there is a need to automate the CI/CD pipeline. The CI/CD pipeline should include source, build, stage, manual approval and production environment.

5. The application will be running in two different regions, so the source code repository needs to
be replicated in the other region as well, in order to pull the code locally within the regions and
avoid any latency issues.

6. The infrastructure and the application need to be under continuous monitoring with notification mechanism.

7. It is necessary to have an approved CI/CD pipeline before the code gets pushed to production.
